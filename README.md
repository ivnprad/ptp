# Precision Time Protocol (PTP) - Modern C++ Implementation

This project implements a simplified **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** using **Boost Asio coroutines** in modern C++ (C++23). The system consists of a PTP server and client that communicate using multicast/unicast UDP messages and synchronize using a 1D Kalman Filter to smooth the delay measurements.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß≠ PTP Clock Sync using SYNC, FOLLOW_UP, DELAY_REQ, and DELAY_RESP messages
- ‚öôÔ∏è Boost Asio coroutines for non-blocking asynchronous I/O
- üì∂ Multicast and Unicast UDP support
- üìâ 1D Kalman filter for delay smoothing and noise adaptation
- üß™ Built-in diagnostics with NIS (Normalized Innovation Squared) tracking

## How it works

- Server sends periodic SYNC and FOLLOW_UP messages with timestamps.
- Client listens, captures timestamps, and sends DELAY_REQ.
- Server replies with DELAY_RESP.
- The client uses all timestamps to compute mean path delay and applies a Kalman filter for better stability.
- System logs estimation quality via NIS values, which help identify filter performance or potential issues.

## Kalman Filter Insights

- Adjusts process noise (Q) based on estimate changes
- Adjusts measurement noise (R) using recent variance
- Logs diagnostic info like Kalman gain, noise levels, and estimation accuracy

## üìù TODO

- [ ] **Implement per-request coroutine handler pattern in server**

    > One perpetual Listener task:  
    > Its only job is to `co_await` a new request.  
    > Many temporary Handler tasks:  
    > When the Listener gets a request, it doesn't process it directly.  
    > Instead, it immediately spawns a new, temporary coroutine to handle that one request.  
    > It passes all the necessary information (like the client's endpoint) as parameters to this new handler task.  
    > The Listener immediately loops back to `co_await` the next request, while the handler task for the first client runs concurrently.  
    > This way, the server can accept a new request from Client B while it's still processing Client A, making it truly concurrent and scalable.

- [ ] **Refactor `WaitDelayRequest` to extract `sequenceId` and pass it**

    > The `sequenceId` should be extracted when a request is received.  
    > It must then be passed to `SendRequestReponse()` and `CreateDelayResponseMessage()`.  
    > The `m_sequenceId` member is owned by the broadcast logic and should not be modified elsewhere.

- [ ] Add unit tests for Kalman filter  
- [ ] Extend support to real Ethernet PTP hardware  
- [ ] Add configuration for multicast groups and interface selection
